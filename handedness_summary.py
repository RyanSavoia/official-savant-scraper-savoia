print("=== HANDEDNESS DATA SUMMARY ===\n")

print("✅ WHAT YOU CAN DO:")
print("1. Filter PITCHERS by handedness (L/R)")
print("   - 193 left-handed pitchers")
print("   - 519 right-handed pitchers")
print("   - Use: statcast_pitch_arsenals_leaderboard(2024, hand='L' or 'R')")

print("\n2. Filter BATTERS by handedness in Fangraphs")
print("   - Use: fangraphs_batting_range(..., batting_hand='L', 'R', or 'S')")
print("   - Access 'Bats' column to see each player's handedness")

print("\n3. Get batter performance vs specific pitch types")
print("   - Includes: ba, slg, woba, whiff_percent, k_percent")
print("   - Use: statcast_pitch_arsenal_stats_leaderboard()")

print("\n❌ WHAT'S NOT AVAILABLE:")
print("1. Pitcher usage by batter handedness (e.g., Cole throws more sliders vs LHB)")
print("2. Batter stats split by pitcher handedness (e.g., Judge vs LHP/RHP)")
print("3. The 'pitch_type' in batter data is the actual pitch (FF, SL, etc.), not pitcher hand")

print("\n💡 WORKAROUND OPTIONS FOR YOUR SCRAPER:")
print("1. Use league averages for platoon advantages")
print("2. Focus on the data you DO have: pitch type matchups with whiff% and k%")
print("3. Consider adding pitcher handedness to your output for manual analysis")
